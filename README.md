Short Description:


Use Case Description: 

Predicting the diabetes disease

1.Predicting diabetes disease: Develop a model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on individual characteristics. The goal is to create a neural network model using Keras basics that accurately classifies individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic.
2.Breast cancer prediction: This use case focuses on applying machine learning techniques to predict the diagnosis of breast cancer. To train a model to determine if a patient's tumour is benign (B) or malignant (M). 
3.Data Normalization Impact on Model Accuracy:In this scenario, the effect of data normalisation on a prediction model's accuracy is evaluated.The aim is to investigate the impact of normalisation on the prediction ability of the model.


Making Use of MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset for Image Classification:

1. Plotting Loss and Accuracy:To determine how well the model is learning, plot the loss and accuracy from training and validation.
2. Image Visualisation and Inference:Use the trained model to predict the value of a handwritten digit from the test data.
3. Investigating Model Architecture:Test the effects of varying the number of hidden layers and activation functions on the model's performance.
4. Evaluating Performance Without Scaling:To determine how scaling affects accuracy, evaluate the model's performance without first preprocessing the images.
